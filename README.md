# N.A.T.-Discord-Tutorials-Bot
Hey there, I was bored and wanted something to do (yes all of our projects are being worked on) so I decided to show how easy things really are to do. I've noticed a lot of developers hyping themselves up and trying to act like they're all that because they wrote 200 lines of JavaScript. So to prove that things are pretty darn easy here's me coding an entire bot in the matter of 10 minutes. I'll prolly be releasing more onto this bot at time goes on. Enjoy!
